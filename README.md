# BookDatabase

This is a simple C++ program that manages books and authors using basic data structures. Each book can have multiple authors, and each author can be linked to multiple books. It runs in the terminal and allows adding books, adding authors, assigning or removing links between them, and listing or searching records.

The code uses arrays and structures without any external libraries. It was mainly written as a college project for practice and understanding how relationships between data can be managed manually.
